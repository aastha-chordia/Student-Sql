# Student Management System (Java + MySQL)

This project is a simple **Student Management System** built using **Java** and **MySQL**.
It demonstrates how to connect a Java application to a MySQL database, perform basic operations (like connecting, creating tables, and accessing data), and manage student information
using a `StudentDAO` and `StudentService` pattern.

# Some Steps
1. **Create the database**:
   Make sure the student_db database exists in your MySQL server.
2. **Connect sql using jdbc**:
   Connect sql database to java so both get updated even if one is changed.
